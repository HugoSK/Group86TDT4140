Steps to run extrovert app:
1. Have python and pip installed and valid as commands in command window

Step 2 varies:
If you are on windows, we have executables that can launch the program.

If you have DJANGO installed, you can run Extrovert.bat under myapp2 folder and it should launch.

If you do NOT have DJANGO installed, or you had an ERROR with the Extrovert.bat, please run ExtrovertExpanded.bat (only needed once, afterwards use other .bat file)

If you are on any other operative system, write the following into your terminal:
1. cd into your current folder.
2. python manage.py runserver
3. open the browser and paste http://127.0.0.1:8000/home

Note that different versions of django might have different functionalities, this is assuming that you have newest version.
